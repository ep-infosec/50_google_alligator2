# SQL Samples

This directory contains sample SQL queries to create views in BigQuery, which in turn can be used to create meaningful and insightful dashboards using Google Data Studio. The views are designed to accomodate customers operating single or multiple Google My Business `Location Groups` within their account, and accordingly, certain statements within the views are commented to aid in this distinction. These are merely samples that can, and should, be tuned according to indiviual purposes.
